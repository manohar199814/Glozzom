            <p class="card-text">Coffee varieties are divided to two main varieties: Arabica and Robusta. These are further divided into multiple varieties and different coffees taste completely different based on the growth conditions of the coffee.
              However, not all Arabica is a specialty coffee. Arabica is cultivated more around the world than Robusta, because of its better flavor. Robusta is more productive and less susceptible to plant diseases, such as leaf rust. However,
              Robustas taste is one-dimensional and bitter. On top of Arabica and Robusta, there is a third main variety Liberica, but its share of the coffee production is less than 1% and it tastes bitter.

              The choice of coffee variety is a major decision for a coffee farmer. Normally the varieties with the best flavor have a smaller yield.

            <p class="card-text justify-content-left">Sachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based on the
              purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close -
              it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull them out at will.</p>

            <p>

              There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off both front foot and back, could tune his technique to suit every condition, temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all
              parts of the world in all conditions.

            <p class="card-text">What a side the Mumbai Indians (MI) have turned out to be. With the emergence of the Pandyas, the Bumrahs and the Ranas they seem to be the most formidable side in the IPL and in T20 set up. The Mumbai based franchise
              seems to be on a record breaking spree, if winning by the highest margin in the IPL history wasnâ€™t enough, they recently became the first side to pocket 100 wins in T20 cricket. This tells you how good they are as a team; they almost
              have everything from world class bowlers and batters, to top fielders and all-rounder, players who are ready to step-up in every situation.Is this the greatest IPL team? PROBABLY!!!</p>
